This repository stores stuff that is involved in my mind.

Focus on Cryptography, Data Structure, and Algorithm.

I have taken the challenge of Cryptopal to enhance my knowledge related to cryptography, it would be nice if this challenge is new to you and this news could invoke your inspiration to learn new things/something hard like cryptography/computer architecture.

Currently using JS - suddenly seeing it as a pure raw language could be suited for challengers who want to build many things from scratch, and manipulate stuff with bits and bytes (> . <)

Ready to build a library or protocol by yourself?  Let's get started!
